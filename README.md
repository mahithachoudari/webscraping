Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites using automated scripts. In Python, this can be achieved using various libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium. These tools allow users to parse HTML/XML content, navigate web pages, and collect structured data for analysis.
Respect Robots.txt: Always check a websiteâ€™s robots.txt file to see if scraping is allowed.
Avoid Overloading Servers: Use delays and limit requests to prevent server crashes.
Use Headers and Proxies: Mimic real users to avoid getting blocked.
Store Data Efficiently: Save scraped data in CSV, JSON, or databases for analysis.
